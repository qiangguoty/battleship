The current version works with Python 2.7 32-bit and needs pygame library.

***
Install pygame:
$ pip install pygame
For Windows, install newest pygame installer from www.pygame.org.

***
Run game:
	# If 32-bit OS, simply
	$ python battleship_gui.py
	# If 64-bit OS, please run it with 32-bit Python binary as pygame runtime does not have a 64-bit version available.
	# For example in Mac OS X:
	$ python2.7-32 battleship_gui.py

***
How to play:
Press any key to skip introduction animation (disabled in current version). Click on left map to drop ships (SPACE to change direction). When all 5 ships are dropped, click squares on right map to attack an enemy coordinate.

***
Run tests:
ai-tester.py can be used to evaluate the performance of AI.
$ python ai-tester <AI1_filename> <AI2_filename> <rounds>
Summarized test results will be generated after all tests end.

To test the difference between memorized and non-memorized AI, use ai-tester-mem.py:
$ python ai-tester-mem <AI1_filename> <AI2_filename> <rounds>

GUI can also be used to test the AI. We did not have enough time to modify GUI to take different AIs as input, but some minor changes in GUIâ€™s code will do.
